# Item-Analyser
Runs basic statistics on inputted item.
Made to keep track of tweaking with Pandas.

What Needs to Be Done:
'''
Put an upper function on item numbers 
error handling when item doesn't exist.
Move prints to some sort of function - the variables are sent to a class.
Print Item Description at the top.
Plot of current stock next to sales.
Bins need to change depending on amount usually purchased (mean).
Simple report of last couple of cycles.
Import the correct types for each variable in the other module.
Need to figure out how to let the user select the file through Windows.
A better way to represent non normal data - or highly variance data.
Compare multiple item numbers.
What is the error to a cycle count - average amount pulled (find average on bimodal information?) versus variance. 
Clean Up Plots
Primitive Frontend.
Scatterplot of amount of sales in a month by cyclecounts. Maybe R2. Maybe only months where cycle counts occur to remove noise.
